## Resume

Hello. 

My name is Minkyu Ray Park. 

This is a simple repository that consists of best projects I have completed and want to share for job applications. 

## Each folders consists of programming language it was used to create the project. 

### Javascript: Covid-19 Tracker 

Covid-19 Tracker utilizes `react, html, javascript, css, npm, Leaflet (Map API), and https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all (Data Import)`. It was a project created for Front-End Web Development class. Utilized tutorial from Clever Programmer on Youtube. This program can be used in all platform `Windows/Mac/Ubuntu and Visual Studio Code`. 

### Python: Wordle Clone using Back-End-Microservices

The New York Times bought a game called Wordle which have been a big hit. Using `json, python, sql (database) , traefik, redis, and crontab` created Wordle game. This project allowed practice back-end microservices such as `creating databases, sharding databases, and load balancing`. This program used `Unbuntu as platform and Visual Studio Code`.

### Swift: Dungeons and Dragon Player Social Media

DnD application uses `Mac as platform and XCode`. Since it was introductory class to Mobile Development, when it comes to functionalities, it is not complete. It did utilize all of the concepts learned in class such as `Navigation View, Test Cases, Buttons and Functionalities, Design (VStack/HStack/emojis/colors/fonts/Custom Shapes/Images), Different @ properties for data implementation (@State, @Binding, @StateObjects, @EnvironmentalObjects, @Observed Objects, more), Text and Textbox, GeometryReader (Distribution of screen size), Lists, and Loops`. 

### Unity: Block Sliding Game

Block Sliding Game utilized `c#` as programming language. It utilizes `physics and materials embedded in the Unity Application`. This program used `Microsoft as platform and Unity`. More than learning professionally about creating games using Unity, it was a personal project I was interested in. Shared with friends and had fun. Utilized tutorial from a Youtube channel called Brackeys.
