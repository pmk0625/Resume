This project was not built for any classes. It was built utilzing a youtube tutorial as a hobby or challenge. 

It was very amusing to play with friends after distributing to them for fun. I conducted immediate modifications to different obsticles due to friend feedbacks. 

Below is the 30 seconds of gameplay.

Created Different Obsticles using Prefab Assets (Size, Height, etc). Placed and modified specific location of each obsticles while testing the distance, possibility, and difficulty. Utilized C# code for movement controls, collisions, player follow, and point system. Utized embedded physics system and material properties in Unity.
