This program is created to gather Dungeons and Dragon Players to meet up and schedule/plan DnD sessions.

This project is not complete since it is introduction class for ios but this project consists of all the previous lab concepts we have learned put together into one application.

Initial screen displays User Account Creation Page. This allows user to register in the application. `Create Account` and `Login buttons` have no functionality at this time.

Moving on to the next tab on the bottom, Nearby Users Page is displayed. `Filter` Button Functionality works but `add` and `message` buttons do not. Names are hard coded with designated distances. `Filter` Button will filter according to the designated distances.
